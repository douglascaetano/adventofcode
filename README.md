My Advent of Code implementations
=================================

This is a collection of my solutions to the [Advent of Code] puzzles.

The code in these solutions were written for fun and learning, not for profit.
They are not necessarily examples of good or professional code, as my intention
is to write code as close to the best practices as possible without losing fun.
